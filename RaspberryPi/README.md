# Overview

This software is intended for use on a Raspberry Pi. When installed correctly, your Pi will start up and immediately begin Homepassing.

# Status

This software currently requires manual installation. Once installed, it functions perfectly, and there are no known bugs.

# TODO:

Make an installer for this software, probably with [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/).

# About

Much of the design for this setup was inspired by [SpillPass](http://www.spillmonkey.com/?page_id=5), which works wonderfully on the Raspberry Pi B, but unfortunately in my experience it does not on the B+ or 2.  With that in mind I decided to improve and expand on its techniques.
